# Volume Control Plus

This app is inspired by [https://github.com/troylar/quiet-on-the-set](https://github.com/troylar/quiet-on-the-set), and this app is built using pure C++ and the native Windows API, making it use much less memory usage compared to "Quiet on the Set", which is written in C#. Not only does it consume less memory, but it can also access the mute system in Windows.
